        <h4>My Role</h4>
        <p>
          As a developer for the Story Builder app, I contributed to designing the user flow and collaborated closely with the team via online chats and meetings to ensure an intuitive user experience (UI). This collaboration allowed me to refine my understanding of UI/UX principles while working with others to align the appâ€™s functionality with user needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app is a single-page application (SPA) that guides users through selecting their ideal LightForm model and imagining its use and setting. I handled both frontend and backend tasks, ensuring the UI was seamless and the app could track and store user selections without requiring login credentials. This presented a unique challenge, as it required maintaining states dynamically and securely storing user data without personal identifiers like names or dates of birth.
        </p>

        <h5>Skills Applied</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Frontend Development: Created an intuitive SPA interface that updated dynamically based on user interactions.</li>
          <li>State Management: Managed and tracked multiple states to ensure seamless navigation and data consistency.</li>
          <li>Backend Development: Built functionality to store user data in the database without requiring authentication.</li>
          <li>Collaboration: Worked effectively with team members to design the user flow and prioritise a smooth UI experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Outcome</h5>
        <p>
          The Story Builder app provided a highly engaging and seamless user experience, enabling potential customers to explore LightForm models and imagine their applications. This project strengthened my skills in frontend and backend development, especially in handling state and database interactions in an SPA environment.
